# Exercise Instructions

1. Navigate to the start directory and install the necessary dependencies:
	```sh
	npm install
	```

2. Run the test suite to ensure everything is set up correctly:
	```sh
	npm run test
	```

3. Add the tests to the appropriate files. The tests become less specific as you move from top to bottom. 

4. For the bottom files that do not have a test file, you will need to create those test files.

5. Refer to the `solutions` folder for guidance if needed.

Happy testing!
